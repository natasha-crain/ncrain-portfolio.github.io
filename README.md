# **Portfolio Website**

This is my first project creating a website using HTML, CSS and JS. It is my personal website that will eventually host front end development projects, as well as a project submission for my Front End Development course with The Learning People.

The website has five pages in total; one a welcome page, thank you page and three navigational pages:

- About Me, which contains a brief introduction, profile image, contact information as well as links for my GitHub, Facebook and Instagram profiles.
- Portfolio, which is currently empty but will be filled in the future.
- Contact Me, which contains a contact form, which when completed and sent, loads a the thank you page.

## Other Sources

Being my first coding project, I researched how to accomplish certain tasks that I wanted for my website, including:

1. [the background animations](https://codepen.io/joyanna/pen/NWGYLNW)
2. [header animation](https://codepen.io/blackjacques/pen/GrNMxv)
3. [responsive navbar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QKOaTYvYUA)
4. [transitions between pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckJ7gdIeebc)
5. [create a working contact form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBUMHRL1fmo&list=PLR8vUZDE6IePk_KvVxrFwesjz8qspsIhd&index=17)

Note: the tutorial for creating a contact form was only needed to get it working, not for the structure and design.
